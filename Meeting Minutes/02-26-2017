Task for project: For this part of the project our group needs to add click and select
functionality in order to move tiles around, have all the tiles uniquely identified 
with integers, create a UML diagram, and refine previous code. 

The main purpose of this meeting was to delegate responsibilities to the each individual
person in the group. The tasks were delegated as the following:

Ben, Nikita, Blake: Click and Select Functionality

Dylan: UML Diagram

Paul: Uniquely identify and number the board tiles and side tiles. 

The rest of the meeting was spent planning and understanding how the project will 
come together. The main point of discussion was how we are going to move individual 
tiles to and from the board. This topic is going to have to be researched. We identified
parts of the code that could be better and where we can improve upon. We also spent time
discussing future meetings and how to better work together as a team.
