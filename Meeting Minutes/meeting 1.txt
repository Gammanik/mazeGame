Started figuring out how to use SVN in eclipse

Getting Started with SVN for Eclipse
Step 1.
// So I learned something.  You right-click on the item
// that you want to checkout in the SVN workspace and
// select checkout.  Then you switch to the Java work
// space view in Eclipse.
Step 2.
// Now make some changes to the file and save it.  Now you
// will have a local "uncommitted" change that is only available
// locally.  To share it with other users, we need to synchronize
// the project with the SVN repository.
Step 3
// If you have an active connection with the repository (i.e. the
// online server and files) then right-click the folder or file 
// and select  Team > Synchronize with Repository
Step 4 
// if you double-click the modified file you can see the file in the
// compare changes view and then you can decide what to do with the
// new changes.
Step 5
// Right-click on the modified file and choose between "Commit" or 
// Revert,  If the changes are good then Commit.
