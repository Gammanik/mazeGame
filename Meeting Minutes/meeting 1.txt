Started figuring out how to use SVN in eclipse

Second Meeting - 2/9/17
Present: Nikita, Ben, Blake, Paul, Dylan Was there for a bit, really snarky.
Getting Started with SVN for Eclipse
Step 1.
// So I learned something.  You right-click on the item
// that you want to checkout in the SVN workspace and
// select checkout.  Then you switch to the Java work
// space view in Eclipse.
Step 2.
// Now make some changes to the file and save it.  Now you
// will have a local "uncommitted" change that is only available
// locally.  To share it with other users, we need to synchronize
// the project with the SVN repository.
Step 3
// If you have an active connection with the repository (i.e. the
// online server and files) then right-click the folder or file 
// and select  Team > Synchronize with Repository
Step 4 
// if you double-click the modified file you can see the file in the
// compare changes view and then you can decide what to do with the
// new changes.
Step 5
// Right-click on the modified file and choose between "Commit" or 
// Revert,  If the changes are good then Commit.
Step 6 
// Get a brewski

// 2/13/17 - Meeting #3 (a.k.a. Loud Heater)
// attendees: Nikita, Paul, Ben

Review of how to commit & pull changes and overwrite local.
Some change, another change.
// Learning : To see our hidden files go to: Window > Show View > Navigator
// Trick: New > Project > General (Don't give it a name here, click next) > then
// name the project > next and/or Finish.
// When importing files into a project you must go higher in the directory structure
// than the folder you want for eclipse to be able to import it properly.
// Eclipse Java Comments Keyboard Shortcut:
//                 							mac type this: "cmd" + "/"
//                                          windows      : "ctrl" + "/"
//                                          dvorak       : "cmd" + "["
// Eclipse: Double click any open tab to make it fullscreen, double click 
//          again to restore.
// Eclipse: search and replace in Java is referred to as refactoring, to do this
// 1. highlight the variable name > refactor > rename , this will change the name
//    of the variable everywhere in the code.
 
// Meeting four 2/14/17 (a.k.a Shot through the taco)
// Attendees: Dylan, Blake, Benjamin
// What occurred : Everyone was informed of what changes were made in the 
// Worked on panels to get the buttons laid out right. Dylan was tasked with finishing formatting
// the buttons.
// Everyone else has the responsibility of getting the tiles laid out right. 

// Meeting five 2/16/17 (a.k.a. UML & Beyond )
// Things look peculiar on the Mac when running. OMG... but Bill Gates and Linus are fine.
// Worked on the UML diagram.  Dylan was a rockstar and got a lot done.  Gold star with oxidation.
// Moved the Tile class to it's own file out of the Board class.
// Ben - Merge Tool

// Meetng six 2-19-17 (a.k.a. We are all one) duration hours
// Attendees: Ben, Blake, Dylan, Nikita, Paul 
// Talked about deliverables, talked about the UML diagram and differing ways to 
// generate it.  
// How does one connect from the library to the Hive?  Some were able to connect
// wirelessly but I am not able to using 5 GHz USB Dongle Wireless adapter on Mac.
// Some discussion on how to best work as a team - ongoing.  
// Ben & Paul installed UML Designer short video tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbHKcSNlr5I
// Eclipse shortcut Mac for running when multimedia functions are enabled Fn + Cmd(⌘) + Shift + F11 

// 2/20/17  Tabs & Space in the Eclipse IDE
// As per Dr. Buckner's discussion today in class I learned how to make sure we
// are not using the tab character and to be sure we are using spaces.
// To check whether we are using tabs or spaces while in Eclipse go under
// Preferences > Java > Code Style > Formatter > Edit > Indentation  if you see
// tab character in here then you may need to create a custom profile and set the
// tab to SPACES and not TABS or the tab character.
// If you've got a new document or haven't paid attention to this subtlety whilst
// developing here is how you can check to see what your tabs are (spaces or tab characters).
// Along the top menu bar of the Eclipse IDE there is a button that looks like a 
// backwards paragraph symbol.  It is the "Show Whitespace Characters" button.  Click 
// on it to show all hidden formatting symbols.
// FIX :Now if you happen to have tab characters and tabs are not spaces as they should be
// here's how to fix it.  Open the find and replace Mac : "Cmd(⌘) + F" or Win : "Ctrl + F".
// In the find input box put: " \t " without the quotes.
// In the Replace With box put: " (4 spaces) " no quotes and those are literal spaces
// we're not putting text in the replace with input box just 4 invisible space characters.
// Now you can go about replacing tab characters with spaces.  :)  you're welcome !!!
