Attendees: Dylan, Nikita, Ben, Blake
Date: 02/26/2017
Location: Library Room 264
Time: 7:00pm - 8:00pm

Task for project: For this part of the project our group needs to add click and select
functionality in order to move tiles around, have all the tiles uniquely identified 
with integers, create a UML diagram, and refine previous code. 

The main purpose of this meeting was to delegate responsibilities to the each individual
person in the group. The tasks were delegated as the following:

Ben, Nikita, Blake: Click and Select Functionality

Dylan: UML Diagram

Paul: Uniquely identify and number the board tiles and side tiles. 

The rest of the meeting was spent planning and understanding how the project will 
come together. The main point of discussion was how we are going to move individual 
tiles to and from the board. This topic is going to have to be researched. We identified
parts of the code that could be better and where we can improve upon. We also spent time
discussing future meetings and how to better work together as a team. 



First Meeting - 2/7/17
Present: Blake, Paul, Ben, Nikita

Started figuring out how to use SVN in eclipse

Second Meeting - 2/9/17
Present: Nikita, Ben, Blake, Paul, Dylan Was there for a bit, really snarky.
Getting Started with SVN for Eclipse
Step 1.
// So I learned something.  You right-click on the item
// that you want to checkout in the SVN workspace and
// select checkout.  Then you switch to the Java work
// space view in Eclipse.
Step 2.
// Now make some changes to the file and save it.  Now you
// will have a local "uncommitted" change that is only available
// locally.  To share it with other users, we need to synchronize
// the project with the SVN repository.
Step 3
// If you have an active connection with the repository (i.e. the
// online server and files) then right-click the folder or file 
// and select  Team > Synchronize with Repository
Step 4 
// if you double-click the modified file you can see the file in the
// compare changes view and then you can decide what to do with the
// new changes.
Step 5
// Right-click on the modified file and choose between "Commit" or 
// Revert,  If the changes are good then Commit.
Step 6 
// Relax

// 2/13/17 - Meeting #3 (a.k.a. Loud Heater)
// attendees: Nikita, Paul, Ben

Review of how to commit & pull changes and overwrite local.
Some change, another change.
// Learning : To see our hidden files go to: Window > Show View > Navigator
// Trick: New > Project > General (Don't give it a name here, click next) > then
// name the project > next and/or Finish.
// When importing files into a project you must go higher in the directory structure
// than the folder you want for eclipse to be able to import it properly.
// Eclipse Java Comments Keyboard Shortcut:
//                 							mac type this: "cmd" + "/"
//                                          windows      : "ctrl" + "/"
//                                          dvorak       : "cmd" + "["
// Eclipse: Double click any open tab to make it fullscreen, double click 
//          again to restore.
// Eclipse: search and replace in Java is referred to as refactoring, to do this
// 1. highlight the variable name > refactor > rename , this will change the name
//    of the variable everywhere in the code.
 
// Meeting four 2/14/17 (a.k.a Shot through the heart, but it's still Taco Tuesday)
// Attendees: Dylan, Blake, Benjamin (Dylan had to leave during the middle of it).
// What occurred : Everyone was informed of what changes were made in the 
// Worked on panels to get the buttons laid out right. Dylan was tasked with finishing formatting
// the buttons.
// Everyone else has the responsibility of getting the tiles laid out right. 

// Meeting five 2/16/17 (a.k.a. UML & Beyond )
// Attendees: Ben & Paul 
// Things look peculiar on the Mac when running. OMG... but Bill Gates and Linus are fine.
// Worked on the UML diagram.  Dylan was a rockstar and got a lot done.  Gold star with oxidation.
// Moved the Tile class to it's own file out of the Board class.
// Ben - Merge Tool

// Meetng six 2-19-17 (a.k.a. We are all one) duration: hours
// Attendees: Ben, Blake, Dylan, Nikita, Paul 
// Talked about deliverables, talked about the UML diagram and differing ways to 
// generate it.  
// How does one connect from the library to the Hive?  Some were able to connect
// wirelessly but I am not able to using 5 GHz USB Dongle Wireless adapter on Mac.
// Some discussion on how to best work as a team - ongoing.  
// Ben & Paul installed UML Designer short video tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbHKcSNlr5I
// Eclipse shortcut Mac for running when multimedia functions are enabled Fn + Cmd(âŒ˜) + Shift + F11 
// The remainder of the code for this part of the project was mostly completed during this meeting as well.

// 2/20/17  Tabs & Space in the Eclipse IDE 
// As per Dr. Buckner's discussion today in class I learned how to make sure we
// are not using the tab character and to be sure we are using spaces.
// To check whether we are using tabs or spaces while in Eclipse go under
// Preferences > Java > Code Style > Formatter > Edit > Indentation  if you see
// tab character in here then you may need to create a custom profile and set the
// tab to SPACES and not TABS or the tab character.
// If you've got a new document or haven't paid attention to this subtlety whilst
// developing here is how you can check to see what your tabs are (spaces or tab characters).
// Along the top menu bar of the Eclipse IDE there is a button that looks like a
// backwards paragraph symbol.  It is the "Show Whitespace Characters" button.  Click 
// on it to show all hidden formatting symbols.
// FIX :Now if you happen to have tab characters and tabs are not spaces as they should be
// here's how to fix it.  Open the find and replace Mac : "Cmd(âŒ˜) + F" or Win : "Ctrl + F".
// In the find input box put: " \t " without the quotes.
// In the Replace With box put: " (4 spaces) " no quotes and those are literal spaces
// we're not putting text in the replace with input box just 4 invisible space characters.
// I almost forgot, make sure in the options the "Regular Expressions" check box
// is checked.
// Now you can go about replacing tab characters with spaces.  :)  you're welcome !!!  
// 
// Okay this is cool. !!!  So let's say someone (Paul) puts in a ton of comments and then
// it comes time to submit our code to Dr. Buckner and there are too many comments, :(.
// Regular Expressions to the rescue.  Open Find/Replace: "Cmd + F" or Win : "Ctrl + F".
//  In the Find: input box put : " \/\/(.*?)\r?\n " without the quotes
//  Leave the Replace with input box blank and make sure "regular expressions" is checked.
//  Hit the Find button, now you can replace all those nasty comments with spaces.
//  Wow, regular expression are cool.
//  Ok, guillemets are kind of cool.... at least when you're making UML diagrams.
//  on Mac alt + \ gives " « " and alt + shift + \ gives "» "
// If you're using Windows here's he article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillemet
//
//Meeting 7 (a.k.a We're almost there)
//Attendees : Paul, Dylan, Blake, and Ben
//Started to pull all of the seperate class diagrams into a single UML
//Bounced around ideas about how to fix some resizing issues.
//Paul and Dylan came up with great ideas that when combined together may fix the 
//resizing issue
//
//Future plans : Ben will investigate how to implement drag and drop 
//Dylan came up with an idea to help fix some resizing issues
//and thus will find a way to explain his idea to the group for 
//the next meeting
//Investigation on how to implement rotation on tiles will commence
