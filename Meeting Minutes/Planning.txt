// Project 2

// Plan

Blake, Paul, Ben, Nikita:

Create Action Listeners to register Tile presses, and allow select 
and place movement functionality.

Dylan:
UML updates, assist when asked for all other tasks.

//Specifics: 
Nikita:
Create Actionlistener for all Components, specifically register presses outside
a tile.

Blake, Ben, Paul:
Send data of each Tile when Tile is moved, format and write all data transfer 
code. Allow tiles to be moved to any open spot.





//Users Guide:

When a Tile is clicked, it will slightly change color to inform the user which 
Tile is about to be moved. Clicking on any other information Tile will cancel 
the selection and wait for more input. Clicking an empty space will move the 
selected Tile to the empty Tile and wait for more input. The only functional menu 
button is the Quit button which merely exits the program.
